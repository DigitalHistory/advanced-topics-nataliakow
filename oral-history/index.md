Add your content here, including _markup_ of **various kinds**. Now you can just write! But you should be aware of a couple of advanced features of markdown:
- you can embed HTML directly n a markdown file. This is great if you want to add complex attributes like **classes**, e.g. to your `img` tags so that they display properly.
  - another use of embedded HTML is for funky javascript function links. I've written a simple function that will seek to a particular time code in seconds.  You can call it like this: `<a href="javascript:seek(75)">seek to 1:15</a>`, but `[seek to 1:15](javascript:seek(75))` won't render properly, so you have to type the whole linke in, as seen here: <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(75)"> seek to 1:15</a>.
  - also, Remarkable supports pandoc-style footnotes, which can be helpful sometimes. Here are some examples of footnotes at work:

    Footnote 1 link[^first].

    Footnote 2 link[^second].

    Inline footnote^[Text of inline footnote] definition.

    Duplicated footnote reference[^second].

you can learn more about remarkable on [its github page](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable), and get a fuller sense of the syntax [in the online demo](https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/)


[^first]: Footnote **can have markup**

    and multiple paragraphs.

The Atomic Bomb: Looking back at its detonation


In New Mexico on July 16, 1945, an atomic bomb, the first of its history, was detonated amid the acrid desert. Set up for the event had been occurring for months with more than four hundred personnel, politicians and physicists at its inauguration detonation.[^first] The bomb was stronger, but not much so, than the bomb that would detonate a few days later in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.[^second] The code -name for this secret operation was called Trinity and was led by General Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. It was a fledgling project that brought in the impetus of nuclear warfare. Highly successful, it allowed the Allied powers to win the war and spare hundreds of lives. It was seen as a huge success and was celebrated, photographer Jack Aeby who took a picture of the detonation stated that: "the whole world lit up."<a href="https://storycorps.org/listen/jack-aeby-atom-bomb-photographer/" onclick="javascript:seek(110)"> seek to 1:14</a> [^third] Many were enthusiastic regarding this huge advancement in technology. However, it also opened the door to future nuclear testing and the improvement of warheads, missiles and bombs. . Eventually, with more testing and recognizing the ramifications that they could produce, regulations were implemented to control their production and detonation. What once connected the Allied powers under an umbrella of mutual defense became a tool used in the Cold War. Operation Trinity opened the doors for future political tension between the east and west which triggered the need for greater control over the production of nuclear weaponry.

Beginning with operation Trinity, the U.S. Government from the years of 1945 to 1962 had done hundreds of nuclear weapons tests in the country and in the surrounding waters. [^fourth] The U.S Government had initially become interested in nuclear weaponry after learning from exiled German scientists that Germany was attempting to create them. [^fifth]  Not believing them, they only became interested after learning that the Germans were not selling any uranium from one of their largest mines, even though they were still producing it. [^sixth]  Later, with the isolation of the element plutonium and with the urgings of President Roosevelt to start investigating nuclear weaponry, the U.S. created their first projects aimed at solely this. Project Trinity was the first nuclear detonation that was plutonium fueled for the sole purpose of achieving implosion.[^seventh]  According to Jack Aeby, other than those who had been present at New Mexico to see the pictures of project Trinity were Churchill, Stalin and Truman. <a href="https://storycorps.org/listen/jack-aeby-atom-bomb-photographer/" onclick="javascript:seek(208)"> seek to 2:12</a> [^eighth] By having this weapon in their tool belt, it was then seen as a weapon to use in wartime relations regarding the far east as seen by J.F.Byrnes: “[He] determined to out maneuver Stalin on China.” [^ninth] Therefore, the Trinity operation had given the U.S. a foothold over the rest of the Allied powers, especially Russia.

As the war ended it was increasingly difficult to understand where to put nuclear weapons in a post-war world. President Truman decided that amid all the confusion as to who should have them and use them above all there would be laws in regulating them. He stated that “the atomic bomb is too dangerous to be loose in a lawless world." [^tenth]  Since they had been in possession of and had used nuclear weapons, the U.S. Government took it upon themselves as trustees of policing future nuclear weapons. On the other hand, there were other politicians who were afraid that this monopoly by the Americans would put pressure on the Soviet Union to further increase their own nuclear advancements. [^eleventh]  Their fears would prove to be right, for the Soviet Union had long been planning their next move, and placement, in the international circle after the world war. Very different ideologically from consumerist England and North America, the tension between the powers had been starting to give way since the Potsdam Conference. Despite this, the U.S. Government maintained that their diplomatic goal was to control the use of atomic weapons instead of using them as an instrument and tool especially against the Soviets.

As relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union deteriorated, the U.S. Government hoped that just the notion of nuclear war would deter the Soviet Union from pursuing such destruction. Although never engaging in a direct war, the two powers were certainly at odds. Suddenly in 1949 in Kazakhstan, the Soviet Unions detonated their first atomic bomb, which fueled anxiety and led the U.S. to build the hydrogen bomb [^twelfth].  This would become one of the main events in the arms race between the two powers. Truman upon being asked as to why he had accepted and promoted the creation of the hydrogen bomb, he had simply stated that it was to be used for bargaining [^thirteenth].  This relationship of trying to outdo the other would translate into every single part of diplomatic relations between the two powers. The bombs were being created in the hopes of never having to use them but simply to instill fear in the other.

 The atomic bomb had initially been created in the hopes of achieving peace and ending the war. It had also united the Allied powers against the Axis and provided them with an international victory and diplomatic power. However, the bomb later became a symbol of a power monopoly by the U.S. in which the Soviet Union disagreed with. This led to the arms race and the struggle for regulations over nuclear weaponry. The Cold War had thus become a war over the most sophisticated technological advancements in the bid for utmost control.
